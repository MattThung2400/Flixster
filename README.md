### Notes

While building the second portion of the app, I had noticed that I made some erroneous mistakes from the previous portion. The biggest mistake I made was hardcoding the image view for the main activity page. This lead the landscape view to improperly display the poster image instead of the backdrop image. This was a simple fix, however. I did struggle to implement data binding and was unable to properly integrate the system across all of my activities.

### Notes
During the first part of this assignment, I did have a little bit of trouble formatting my design in a manner such that the text was not overflowing onto the next section (for portrait mode). I decided to use the 'maxHeight' and 'maxLines' properties to fix this issue. As developers, we need to be aware of the size of the data that we are trying to display, and subsequently code for fringe cases where we have too much or too little data.
